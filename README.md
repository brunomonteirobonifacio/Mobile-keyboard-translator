# Mobile-keyboard-translator

This code is supposed to translate text written in mobile/phone keyboard.
Unfortunately, the only way I could make it work until this date (02/02/2023) was by making it translate only one character per time, which I put a link to.

UPDATE: Its all working fine now, as far as I know.
